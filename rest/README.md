# REST API implementation

This is an Actix web implementation of a REST API. It is a simple API that
allows you to perform all actions on the db through HTTP requests.

## Running the API

Running this API is simple. Just make sure to have a firefly instance running
and then cargo run (or build) it.

## Future notes:

Will probably convert this into a clap app so that its config is dynamic.
